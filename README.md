# Belly Button Challenge

This excercise is used to explore Belly Button Biodiversity dataset which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

Using the D3 library to read data we built 1 bar graph to show the top ten bacteria found in each individual as well as a bubble graph showing the type and number of bacteria found in the selected individual, which is identified by an ID. Additionally, the demographic information of the selected individual is shown.
